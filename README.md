## About

This is a workshop written and taught by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/) and [Manaswi Mishra](https://manaswimishra.com/), research assistants at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/)'s [Opera of the Future](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/) research group.

## Software installation

Today we are using [ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), a free libre open-source software for computer music.

Please download the ChucK installer or executable from the ChucK website, after which you will have an app called "miniAudicle" on your computer.

## ChucK basics

ChucK scripts have the extension ".ck"

We can write code with any text editor, today we will use miniAudicle.

Remember to start the virtual machine.

All ChucK commands end with a semicolon ";"
