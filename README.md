## About

This is a workshop written and taught by Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga, with teaching assistant Manaswi Mishra, research assistants at MIT Media Lab's Opera of the Future research group.

## Software installation

Today we are using [ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), a free libre open-source software for computer music.

Please download the ChucK installer or executable from the ChucK website, after which you will have an app called "miniAudicle" on your computer.
